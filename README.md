Front End for a Reddit style news aggregation app.

## Getting Started

---

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Clone the repository to a directory on your local machine:

```js
git clone https://github.com/SpenceUK/NC-News-Front-End.git
```

Open the directory and install itâ€™s dependencies:

To start a development environment:

This will launch a server and live version of your app, you can make changes to your code and on save these changes will be reflected on the live page.

npm i netlify
